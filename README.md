C# practice exercice

This is a self-imposed, beginner-level exercise to practice C# and learn a little bit of Windows Forms 
and just (ugly) UI for C# in general. This calculator is terible, can only execute one operation at a 
time and doesn't have negatives. It is not meant to be very useable. I'll probably work on a new, 
better calculator as a second (or nth) exercise to implement more functionalities, practice other 
concepts and simply, overall, have better design for it. 

Maybe. :V
